Data Science is a trendy topic nowadays. We analyze customers behavior when they are browsing an e-commerce website to improve user experience, apply fraud detection mechanisms to prevent malicious transactions and use image recognition to know [what's a hot dog and what is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=63&v=ACmydtFDTGs).  
At the same time, there are not too many data-powered instruments that would help us, software engineers, improve our experience of writing high-quality code.  
Git, in its turn, is not only a must-have tool in our day-to-day job but also a source of valuable data hiding the insights about both source code and people who develop it.
