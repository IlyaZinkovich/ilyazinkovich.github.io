To achieve the best performance out of any system, we need to plan it capacity carefully. Be it the servers, bus lines, or couriers, we need to ensure the system has enough resources to handle the given level of demand.  
This time I'll show you how we can use a mathematical model to make data-driven decisions on the capacity.
Example of food delivery couriers shifts planning.

## Measure

The first step in improvement is measurement of its current performance.

## Planning

In the food delivery business, the fleet generally consists of full-time and part-time couriers.
Full-timers provide basic system operations, have strict shifts, and receive a fixed salary. Part-timers, on the other hand, boost system performance during periods of high demand and earn based on their availability.
